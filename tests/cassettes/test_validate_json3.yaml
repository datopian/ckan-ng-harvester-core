        Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient

        hospital inpatient stays. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million
        hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations
        nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel

        counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia
        as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during
        a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of
        death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate
        relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust
        provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional

        month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted
        provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug
        classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and
        predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose
        occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts

        measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical
        notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug
        overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving
        specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical

        death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National
        Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff
        date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates
        include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
        NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through
        the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe
        timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital
        Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e.,
        the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for
        analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of
        death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported
        6 months after the date of death.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvisional
        death counts presented in this data visualization are for \u201c12-month ending
        periods,\u201d defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period
        ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in
        June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30,
        2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and
        are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month
        period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison.
        These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality
        metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging
        trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the
        degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period.
        Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based
        on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.
        Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted
        provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting
        (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed
        reporting).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvisional data are based on available

        nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the
        International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
        (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to
        code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and
        poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying
        cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported
        on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the
        format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification.
        Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to
        ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction
        Manual (2).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrug overdose deaths are identified
        using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD\u201310):
        X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and
        Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug
        categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug
        categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including
        morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone,
        hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic
        opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including
        drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants
        with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose
        deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes:
        opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone
        (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other
        and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose
        deaths where \u2018opioid\u2019 is reported without more specific information
        to assign a more specific ICD\u201310 code (T40.0\u2013T40.4) (3,4). Among
        deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least
        one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD\u201310
        multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36\u2013T50.8.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrug
        overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might
        be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose
        deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin
        and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths
        involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic
        opioids other than methadone.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESelection of specific
        states and other jurisdictions to report\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nProvisional counts
        are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting
        jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by
        reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions
        based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner
        of death is listed as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d the overall completeness
        of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific
        drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPercentage
        of records pending investigation\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrug overdose
        deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be
        initially filed with a manner of death \u201cpending investigation\u201d and\/or
        with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records
        reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d is high for a given jurisdiction,
        the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions
        reporting fewer than 1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d, the
        provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter
        of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths
        occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than
        1% of records as \u201cpending investigation\u201d the provisional counts
        of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose
        deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1%
        or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as \u201cpending investigation,\u201d
        following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.
        Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release
        and reflect the most current data available.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPercent
        completeness\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENCHS receives monthly counts of
        the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration
        offices (referred to as \u201ccontrol counts\u201d). This number represents
        the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each
        month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded
        cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing
        the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for
        each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more
        information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid
        Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness
        was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending
        periods included in the dashboard.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDrug specificity\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe
        percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified
        as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected
        jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates
        mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods
        included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where
        a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented
        for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally,
        as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where
        at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs
        the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve,
        the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether
        additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria
        described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons
        across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are
        shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each
        monthly release and reflect the most current data available.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdjustments
        for delayed reporting\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvisional counts of drug
        overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of
        underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with
        the manner of death reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d and tends
        to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically,
        the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent
        in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as \u201cpending
        investigation,\u201d and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent
        months.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMethods were developed to adjust provisional
        counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending
        period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death
        \u201cpending investigation.\u201d Briefly, these methods involve developing
        \u2018multiplication factors\u2019 based on the degree of underreporting in
        provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts
        of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data,
        then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported
        provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted
        provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe
        12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death
        reported as \u201cpending investigation\u201d were used to predict the degree
        of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these
        models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be
        applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate
        predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent
        a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays
        related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death
        \u201cpending investigation.\u201d It is important to note that flat or declining
        numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due
        to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination
        of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths
        across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESource:

        This dataset includes data from the retired BRFSS Vision Module. From 2005-2011
        the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment,
        access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013
        and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: \u201cAre
        you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d
        The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye
        Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population
        estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well
        as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information

        dataset provides the proportion of developers, by market share, that have
        certified 2015 edition health IT modules. Market share approximations are
        determined through an analysis of the certified health IT products reported
        by participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program from 2011 to 2016. Approximations
        use the most recently reported data for each unique clinician and hospital
        participant. It is important to understand how to interpret these approximations.
        Some clinicians and hospitals report certified software from more than one
        unique developer. The market share percentages in this dataset, therefore,
        include some double counting (the percentages will, if summed together, add
        up above 100 percent.) The approximations convey the percent of hospitals
        and clinicians who use a developer\u0027s technology, and are not to be interpreted
        in aggregate as the percent of all hospitals and clinicians who have access

        DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare
        Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute
        requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology
        for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies
        (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the
        effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts,
        which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare
        program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services.
        The Competitive Acquisition Omburdsmans (CAOs) role is to help ensure that
        inquiries and complaints about the Program are resolved. As an ombudsman,
        the CAO also works with other areas of CMS to identify potential systemic
        issues with the goal of helping CMS ensure that beneficiaries have access
        to and suppliers provide high-quality DMEPOS items and services. The CAO also
        provides an annual report to Congress. In order to protect the interests of
        potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has been conducting real-time
        claims analysis to monitor health status for groups of Medicare beneficiaries
        in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Health status results are shown in the
        files on this site. Each file includes a written summary of results and graphical
        displays of key indicators reflective of the health status of beneficiaries
        and their access to DMEPOS items and services. The data is derived from claims

        Affordable Care Act requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
        (HHS) to develop quality data collection and reporting tools such as a Quality
        Rating System (QRS), a Quality Improvement Strategy (QIS) and an enrollee
        satisfaction survey system (ESS). The QRS, QIS, and ESS will inform consumer
        selection of a qualified health plan (QHP), decisions about QHP certification,
        and the Federal and State Marketplaces monitoring of QHP performance. The
        QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents
        describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and
        the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer
        experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the
        Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace
        Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided
        by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose
        of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace
        Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and
        whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing
        a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment
        are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience
        Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives
        on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces. Copies
        of the current survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese, are available on this

        is justified. This analysis will help moderate premium hikes and lower costs
        for individuals, families, and businesses that buy insurance in these markets.
        Additionally, insurance companies must provide easy to understand information
        to their customers about their reasons for unreasonable rate increases, as

        April 30, 2012, CMS issued a national coverage determination (NCD) to allow
        coverage of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for the treatment of bronchiolitis
        obliterans syndrome (BOS) following lung allograft transplantation when ECP
        is provided in a clinical research study under the coverage with evidence
        development policy (CED). BOS is estimated to be present in more than 50 percent
        of lung allograft recipients at five years after transplantation, and remains
        a major obstacle to long-term lung transplant survival. One of the requirements
        of a CED research study protocol is that it should discuss how the results
        are or are not expected to be generalizable to the Medicare population, to
        allow statistical inferences about whether Medicare patients may benefit from
        the intervention. The download on this page provides a table of the incidence

        Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database
        designed to support the FDA\u0027s post-marketing safety surveillance program
        for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS
        to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with
        these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care
        is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication
        error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians,
        pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members,
        lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report
        these events to the products\u0027 manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives
        an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified
        by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted
        from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative.
        Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases
        using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM
        DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of

        November 16, 1988, the President of the United States signed into law the
        Generic Animal Drug and Patent Restoration Act (GADPTRA). Among its major
        provisions, the Act extends eligibility for submission of Abbreviated New
        Animal Drug Applications (ANADAs) to all animal drug products approved for
        safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The
        Act also requires that each sponsor of an approved animal drug product submit
        to the FDA certain information regarding patents held for the animal drug
        or its method of use. The Act requires that this information, as well as a
        list of all animal drug products approved for safety and effectiveness, be
        made available to the public. This list must be updated monthly under the
        provisions of the Act. This publication, which is known as the \ufffdGreen
        Book\ufffd, was first published in January of 1989. Updates have been added
        monthly since then. The list is published in its entirety each January.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/www.accessdata.fda.gov\/scripts\/animaldrugsatfda\/index.cfm","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"interactive

        includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic
        disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use
        of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology
        and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
        Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a
        first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities
        and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500
        largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities.
        These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform
        development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention
        activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local
        interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program
        or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include
        Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census
        Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016,
        2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year
        in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood

        dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999.
        Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent
        of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the
        injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful,
        whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted
        by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted
        are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes
        the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological
        harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle
        traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EData
        are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the
        50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000
        standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations
        used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates
        based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years
        are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for
        non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population
        estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECauses
        of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases,
        Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism
        generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality
        matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause
        of death.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESOURCES\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECDC\/NCHS,

        is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2016 release. This dataset
        includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic
        disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use
        of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology
        and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
        Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a
        first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities
        and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500
        largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities.
        These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform
        development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention
        activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local
        interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program
        or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include
        Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census
        Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013,

        population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used
        for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based
        on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated

        county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained
        according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical
        models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted
        death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999\u20132015. These
        annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties
        to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small
        population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo.,
        and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City,
        Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the

        The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence
        of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use
        among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating
        both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.  NATS was designed
        as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized
        adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed
        to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels.

        models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted
        death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999\u20132015. These
        annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties
        to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small
        population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo.,
        and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City,
        Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the
        mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage

        class sessions. GHPSS follows an anonymous, self-administered format for data
        collection. GHPSS uses a core questionnaire on demographics, prevalence of
        cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco
        use, exposure to secondhand smoke, desire for smoking cessation, and training
        received regarding patient counseling on smoking cessation techniques. Questionnaires

        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone
        and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains
        a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately
        4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data
        from the AQS is considered the \u0022gold standard\u0022 for determining outdoor
        air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations
        are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples
        for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when
        air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a
        statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental
        public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors
        and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This
        data does not include \u0022Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS
        (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor
        PM2.5)\u0022. Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View

        Global School dataset.  The Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS)
        was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with
        the United Nations\u0027 UNICEF, UNESCO, and UNAIDS; and with technical assistance

        aged 13-17 years in countries around the world.  It uses core questionnaire
        modules that address the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children
        and adults worldwide: 1) Alcohol use, 2) dietary behaviors, 3) drug use, 4)
        hygiene, 5) mental health, 6) physical activity, 7) protective factors, 8)
        sexual behaviors that contribute to HIV infection, other sexually-transmitted
        infections, and unintended pregnancy, 9) tobacco use, and 10) violence and

        This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data
        indicators from Medicare, stratified by all available combinations of age
        group, race\/ethnicity, gender, and state. Medicare claims for VEHSS includes
        beneficiaries who were fully enrolled in Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS)
        for the duration of the year. Medicare claims provide a convenience sample
        that includes approximately 30 million individuals annually, which represents
        nearly 89% of the US population aged 65 and older and 3.3% of the US population
        younger than 65, including persons disabled due to blindness. Medicare data
        for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Medical Diagnoses indicators. Data
        were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy.
        Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS
        Medicare analyses can be found on the VEHSS Medicare webpage (link). Information

        is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2017 release. This dataset
        includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic
        disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use
        of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology
        and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
        Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a
        first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities
        and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500
        largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities.
        These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform
        development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention
        activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local
        interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program
        or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include
        Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census
        Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015,

        and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003\u20132015.
        These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality
        files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the
        birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County,
        a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates
        indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and
        19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason,
        Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia,
        was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality
        file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County,
        Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted
        on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries
        are consistent with the vintage 2005\u20132007 bridged-race population file

        are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
        (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying
        cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide),
        X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEstimates
        are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death
        mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard
        population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used
        for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based
        on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated
        in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised
        using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously
        published.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDeath rates for some states and years
        may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification
        of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined
        and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is
        known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but
        also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may
        be underestimated in those instances.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmoothed
        county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained
        according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical
        models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted
        death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level
        estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates
        of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates
        for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published
        estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different
        county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion
        of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found
        here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado,
        and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge
        County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while
        Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears
        in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent
        counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across
        the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage
        2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications
        noted previously (7,8).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EREFERENCES\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n1.

        implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies
        on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United
        States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must
        be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located
        in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified
        by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals.
        The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures
        both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs
        are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason
        a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit
        to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included:
        drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts,
        malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications
        that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset
        provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription
        drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases,
        substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used
        in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients
        aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize
        up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation
        and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of
        case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan
        area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include
        the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol,
        non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals,
        and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category,
        sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are
        included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the
        Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED
        visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1

        measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The
        surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information
        is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members
        of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first
        use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug
        classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,
        alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain
        relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance
        abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included
        questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related
        disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources
        and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest
        record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain
        questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \u0022youth experiences\u0022
        items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal
        activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities,
        exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived
        adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included
        are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using
        drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and
        cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity,

        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey,
        Adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was
        included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess
        impairment due to mental health problems. In the 2009 NSDUH, however, all
        of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background

        need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal

        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey,
        adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was
        included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess
        impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however,
        all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background

        Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates
        of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly,
        as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit
        drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged
        12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual,
        and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and
        crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical
        use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
        and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived
        need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal
        and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal
        activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and
        needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained
        in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12
        to 17. These \u0022youth experiences\u0022 items covered a variety of topics,
        such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,
        social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention
        and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and
        activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related
        themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and
        access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs,
        driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco
        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey,
        adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was
        included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess
        impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however,
        all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background
        information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational
        level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This

        Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health
        surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED)
        visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug
        Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
        (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and
        Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral
        Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology
        has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability
        of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully
        implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies
        on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United
        States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must
        be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located
        in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified
        by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals.
        The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures
        both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs
        are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason
        a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit
        to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included:
        drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts,
        malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications
        that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset
        provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription
        drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases,
        substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used
        in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients
        aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize
        up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation
        and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of
        case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan
        area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include
        the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol,
        non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals,
        and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category,
        sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are
        included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the
        Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED
        visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1

        Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health
        surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED)
        visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug
        Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
        (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and
        Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral
        Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology
        has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability
        of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully
        implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies
        on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United
        States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must
        be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located
        in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified
        by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals.
        The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures
        both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs
        are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason
        a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit
        to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included:
        drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts,
        malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications
        that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset
        provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription
        drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases,
        substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used
        in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients
        aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize
        up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation
        and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of
        case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan
        area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include
        the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol,
        non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals,
        and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category,
        sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are

        need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal
        and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal
        activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and
        needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained

        such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,
        social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention
        and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and
        activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related
        themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and
        access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs,
        driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco
        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey,
        adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was

        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal
        and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal
        activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and
        needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained
        in the 2008 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12
        to 17. These \u0022youth experiences\u0022 items covered a variety of topics,
        such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,
        social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention
        and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and
        activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related
        themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and
        access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs,
        driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco
        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For this 2008
        survey, Adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. A split-sample design also was included
        to administer separate sets of questions to assess impairment due to mental
        health problems. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity,
        marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current
        household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602","title":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602","keyword":["addiction","alcohol","alcohol

        on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United
        States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as
        well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:
        marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol,
        tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers,
        tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse
        treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions
        concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders.
        Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts,
        health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems
        resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are

        adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included
        are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using
        drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and

        Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health
        surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED)
        visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug
        Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
        (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and
        Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral
        Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology
        has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability
        of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully
        implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies
        on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United
        States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must
        be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located
        in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified
        by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals.
        The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures
        both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs
        are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason
        a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit
        to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included:
        drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts,
        malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications
        that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset
        provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription
        drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases,
        substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used
        in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients
        aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize
        up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation
        and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of
        case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan
        area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include
        the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol,
        non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals,
        and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category,
        sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are
        included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the
        Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED
        visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1

        National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National
        Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates
        of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly,
        as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit
        drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged
        12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual,
        and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and
        crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical
        use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
        and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived
        need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal
        and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal
        activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and
        needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained
        in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12
        to 17. These \u0022youth experiences\u0022 items covered a variety of topics,
        such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,
        social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention
        and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and
        activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related
        themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and
        access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs,
        driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco
        brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey,
        adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological
        distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the
        past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was
        included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess
        impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however,
        all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background
        information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational
        level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.\u003Cbr

        Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health
        surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED)
        visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug
        Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
        (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and
        Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral
        Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology
        has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability
        of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully
        implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies
        on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United
        States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must
        be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located
        in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified
        by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals.
        The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures
        both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs
        are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason
        a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit
        to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included:
        drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts,
        malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications
        that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset
        provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription
        drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases,
        substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used
        in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients
        aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize
        up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation
        and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of
        case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan
        area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include
        the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol,
        non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals,
        and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category,
        sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are
        included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the
        Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED
        visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1

        from public and private substance abuse treatment programs that receive public
        funding. Data collected both at admission and at discharge is included. The
        unit of analysis is a treatment discharge. TEDS-D consists of data reported

        information from each privately- and publicly-funded facility in the country
        that provides substance abuse treatment as well as from state-identified facilities
        that provide other substance abuse services. Data are collected on a number

        testing, health, continuing care, special programs, transitional services,
        community outreach, ancillary), type of treatment, numbers of clients, and
        various client characteristics. The main objective of the UFDS is to produce
        data that can be used to assess the nature and extent of substance abuse treatment
        services, to assist in the forecast of treatment resource requirements, to
        analyze treatment service trends, to conduct national, regional, and state-level

        National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the principal source of information
        on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United
        States and is one of the major data collection programs of the National Center
        for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers for Disease Control
        and Prevention (CDC). The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for
        a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical
        information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability
        in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions.
        The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview
        Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted
        by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National
        Vital Statistics Division were combined.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nNHIS data are used
        widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor
        trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national
        health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community
        for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing
        those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and
        using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\u003Cbr
        \/\u003E\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household
        surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys
        have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth
        used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure
        Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage
        includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index
        (NDI).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since
        1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years.
        In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This
        revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997
        and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","identifier":"a8f0a8b3-d514-4b7f-9572-17df46727789","license":"https:\/\/opendatacommons.org\/licenses\/odbl\/1.0\/","modified":"2016-04-05","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers

        National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National
        Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates
        of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly,
        as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit
        drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged
        12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual,
        and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and
        crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical
        use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
        and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived
        need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal

        Census Bureau report, Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support:
        2011. The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial
        parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March\/April
        2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion
        of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011.
        The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011,
        representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty
        rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role
        that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially
        during an economic downturn.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","identifier":"65f41ddb-094b-4181-a85a-ce55a945312e","keyword":["Arrears

        November 16, 1988, the President of the United States signed into law the

        safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The
        Act also requires that each sponsor of an approved animal drug product submit

        provisions of the Act. This publication, which is known as the \u201cGreen

        as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of
        scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG\/EEG and optical imaging.
        Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience,
        including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out
        relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can

        National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly
        titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information
        from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides
        substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA\u0027s
        Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol
        Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism
        for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States
        substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly
        DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service\u0027s
        datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other
        two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services
        (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive
        listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States.
        The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded
        substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web
        site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level
        data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as
        data on the facilities providing the treatment.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EData
        collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment
        and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary
        focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline
        operation, methadone\/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)\/buprenorphine dispensing,
        counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages
        in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients
        (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding
        fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure\/certification.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe
        data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used
        in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of
        drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout
        the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration
        of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place,
        and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance
        Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was
        redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from
        1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey
        was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full
        survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment
        Services (N-SSATS).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EN-SSATS is a point-prevalence
        survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and
        its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent
        annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \u0022snapshot\u0022 of substance
        abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the
        N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference
        date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness
        of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected
        for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using
        the new reference date.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe N-SSATS is sponsored

        Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) is an administrative data system providing
        descriptive information about the national flow of admissions to providers
        of substance abuse treatment. The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client
        Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
        and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation
        with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate
        national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA\u0027s
        Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol
        Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of
        Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National
        Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive
        listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component
        of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS),
        formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is
        an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism
        and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS\/UFDS is available from the
        SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information
        on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and
        drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals.
        TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance
        abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively
        tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide
        TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all
        admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions.
        The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state
        reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability
        of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated
        to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known
        admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe
        TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics
        of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs
        receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required
        reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as
        reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional
        variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state
        data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments,
        primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed
        in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health
        insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use,
        pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and
        demographic variables.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe TEDS data collection
        effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states. Within
        each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including
        the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies,
        are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless

        Daily Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are geographically
        aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor air, spanning
        the years 2003-2008. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic
        diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure
        of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b5g\/m\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b3),
        the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard
        deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus
        the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month,
        day) and specified fine particulate matter (\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b5g\/m\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b3)value.
        County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial
        resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program \/
        Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center \/
        Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm
        of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces
        (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two
        sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm,
        US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ
        data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution
        Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data.

        risk\/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana

        administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of
        the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999,
        the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage
        area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
        At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews
        and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews
        and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey\u0027s title
        was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).
        Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then.
        This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior
        to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial
        census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data

        The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be
        adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and
        in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program
        is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking.
        Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver
        cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program
        will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national
        tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips,
        motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and
        interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists
        of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the
        user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks
        post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also
        sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the
        response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in
        dealing with craving, stress\/mood, and responding to slips\/relapses by texting
        specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned
        to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below.
        Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option
        is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone
        providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used
        within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that
        users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency
        (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends,
        a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and
        quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the
        program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific
        groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers
        for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional
        data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants
        will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages
        will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have
        the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program
        can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within
        the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT
        \u0022light\u0022 version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do
        not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive
        support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive.
        In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without
        fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as
        a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages.
        Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- #
        days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than
        14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on
        that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date,
        the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4
        (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that
        everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses
        throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message
        library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety
        of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging,
        and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading
        up to and following the user\u0027s quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support,
        efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user\u0027s quit
        date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started
        to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program
        as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also
        designed to assess the user\u0027s mood, craving level, and smoking status
        several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized
        as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response
        from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user\u0027s
        answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive
        a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages
        rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system
        one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will
        send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10
        messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis,
        decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After
        the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one,
        three, and six months to check on the user\u0027s smokefree status and offer
        additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2
        Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings
        and deal with quitting smoking in general. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Motivation\/encouragement:
        Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey
        despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2
        Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient
        points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment.
        -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into
        the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the
        user\u0027s experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback
        based on the user\u0027s response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions:
        mood, craving, and smoking status. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Reactive Messaging
        (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program
        that will return a text message relevant to the user\u0027s request for help.
        In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send
        them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various
        aspects of cessation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/smokefree.gov\/health-care-professionals","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"http:\/\/smokefree.gov\/health-care-professionals","title":"Widget

        drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged
        12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual,
        and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and
        crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical
        use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
        and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived
        need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied.
        The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse
        and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal

        Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer
        are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative.  This dataset
        provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue
        about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity,
        heart disease, cancer). The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only
        for public health professionals but also for members of the community who
        are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains
        over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI
        presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative
        to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet,
        physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially
        contribute to these deaths.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"ftp:\/\/ftp.cdc.gov\/pub\/Health_Statistics\/NCHS\/Datasets\/CHDI\/chsi_dataset.zip","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"csv","accessURL":"ftp:\/\/ftp.cdc.gov\/pub\/Health_Statistics\/NCHS\/Datasets\/CHDI\/chsi_dataset.zip","title":"CSV
